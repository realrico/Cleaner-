Rust and Anti-Cheat Cleaner - Made by @realrico: 
This is a simple Rust and Anti-Cheat (AC) cleaner designed for all-around use, primarily focused on helping users for their own purposes.

Overview: 
The "login" window is implemented for safety reasons. Initially, I planned to develop this cleaner with the intention of selling it, but I have decided to launch it as an open-source project.

The cleaner functions effectively and accomplishes its tasks, even if its appearance isn't the most polished. It is specifically designed to clean RUST and all Steam files related to the game, where it performs best. The Anti-Cheat cleaning option is versatile and applicable to various Anti-Cheat systems, with a primary focus on Easy Anti-Cheat (EAC).

If you have cleaned RUST, I recommend using the Anti-Cheat cleaning option as well for improved performance.

Usage Instructions: 
Run as Administrator: Ensure you run the .bat file as an administrator for the cleaner to work properly; otherwise, it may not function as intended.

Logging Feature: A logging feature has been implemented to allow users to check each step the cleaner takes, helping to avoid potential issues.

Killer.bat: The killer.bat script launches before the user interface starts to prevent mistakes during the cleaning process.

Password: The password to access the cleaner is: rico.

Starting the Tool: To start the tool, run Launch.bat in administrator mode.

Feel free to check the code for yourself or make further edits as needed. I hope this tool proves helpful!
