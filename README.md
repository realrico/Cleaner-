this is a simple game and AC cleaner for all round use, mainly focused on user usage for their own purpose. 

the "login" window exists for safety reasons, i have mainly planned on programming this cleaner more to maybe sell it, but i've decided to launch it as open source. 

the cleaner works pretty good and does its job even if its not the best looking one. 

its focused on cleaning RUST and all steam files connected to the game. that's where its performing. the Anti-Cheat clean option is all round for every Anti-cheat. Mainly eac.

if you have cleaned rust i would recommend using the Anti-Cheat clean option aswell, this is just for better performance. 

i hope that this tool helps, make sure to run the .bat as Admin to use the cleaner properly, otherwise it wont work. 

i have implemented a log feature, just for the user to check every step the cleaner makes to evade problems.

You can check the code for yourself or edit it further.

The killer.bat launches before the ui starts, to prevent mistakes in the cleaning process.

Make sure to run everything in ADMIN mode.

to start the tool run: Launch.bat in admin mode.
